        <p>In this week and last week's study, we started to learn how to create a portfolio website of our own.</p>
          <p>   I am very interested in this because as an artist I have never known how to store my work effectively and display my work to others more conveniently.</p>
           <p>  These are just very important to me. And I'm going to start some small entrepreneurial ventures. I'm going to start selling some trinkets.</p>
             <p>  This knowledge will also help me create an online store of my own.</p>
